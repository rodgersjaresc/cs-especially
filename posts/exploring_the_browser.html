                Modern web browsers are, in themselves, complete software environments. Considering that nearly every computer on earth nowadays has a web browser,
                they present an awesome opportunity for learning about software engineering and programming. In this post, we will explore what the browser has to 
                offer CS learners.<br />
                <br />
                Firstly, let's think for just a moment about what exactly a web browser does. It allows a user to request resources from web servers somewhere on 
                the network the computer is connected to. That network may be the Internet or a local intranet, regardless, a URL is typed into the address bar, 
                sent across the network, and hopefully a file is returned to the browser. Typically, that file is an HTML or HyperText Markup Language file. HTML 
                is a language that a person or machine uses to structure text and other media into a document that the browser interprets and displays on screen. 
                That's it. An HTML file comes in, the browser reads, or parses, it and displays it to the user. HTML alone can be quite 
                plain. As a result, browsers also process another type of file called a Cascading Style Sheet, or CSS file which applies decoration or styling to 
                HTML.<br />
                <br />
                Modern web pages offer interactive features such as the ability to change content on a page by clicking buttons. Some of this interactivity 
                is defined in HTML, or the browser itself, such as clicking a link causing the URL that link contains to be loaded, however, the browser also 
                has its own programming language available for adding functionality to webpages far beyond that offered by HTML or CSS. This language is called 
                JavaScript.<br />
