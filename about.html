                    It attempts to offer students and teachers ideas and inspiration to experiment with Computer Science topics outside those
                    generally presented in CS education circles. Computers, programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and various 
                    combinations of each offer infinite opportunities for creativity, fun, and real world-changing 
                    innovation. This site's ultimate goal is to expose learners to these topics from as many weird angles as possible. The 
                    posts here are intended to act as starting points for full excursions into the CS concepts they present.
